# GoogleGeminiSwift

**GoogleGeminiSwift** is a SwiftUI project that showcases the integration of the Gemini SDK to create an AI-powered chatbot, inspired by the functionality of OpenAI's conversational models. This project is built with a focus on modularity, employing a separate local Swift Package Manager (SPM) package to handle the Gemini SDK integration. This approach not only improves code organization but also enhances scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with a conversational AI using the Gemini SDK.
- **Modular Design**: The integration of the Gemini SDK is modularized within a local SPM package, allowing for better separation of concerns and easier management of dependencies.
- **SwiftUI Interface**: The entire UI is built using SwiftUI, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience that is easy to customize and extend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main components:

### 1. **Main Application (`GoogleGeminiSwift`)**
   - **GeminiView**: The core SwiftUI view responsible for rendering the chatbot interface. It manages user inputs and displays AI-generated responses in real-time.
   - **ViewModel**: Handles the business logic, managing the state and communication with the Gemini SDK.
   - **Configuration**: The `Info.plist` file stores essential configuration data, such as the API key for the Gemini SDK.

### 2. **Local SPM Package (`GeminiPackage`)**
   - **Purpose**: Encapsulates all the code related to the Gemini SDK, enabling a modular architecture.
   - **Advantages**: Promotes clean code practices by isolating third-party dependencies, making the project more maintainable and easier to test.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Xcode**: Ensure you have Xcode 14 or later installed.
- **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**: The project leverages SPM for managing the local package.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gurungboi/GoogleGeminiSwift.git
   cd GoogleGeminiSwift
   ```

2. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Open the project in Xcode.
   - Navigate to the `Info.plist` file.
   - Add your Gemini API key under the `API_KEY` entry.

3. **Build and Run:**
   - Choose your desired simulator or device.
   - Click on the `Run` button in Xcode to build and launch the app.

### Usage

- **Interacting with the Chatbot:**
  - Type your message into the provided text field.
  - Click the send button (depicted as a paper plane) to interact with the AI.
  - The response generated by the Gemini SDK will appear in the chat window.

## Future Enhancements

- **Error Handling**: Implement more sophisticated error handling mechanisms to improve user experience.
- **Extended AI Capabilities**: Explore adding support for more advanced AI models or features within the Gemini SDK.
- **UI/UX Refinements**: Continuously improve the interface to make the chatbot more engaging and user-friendly.
